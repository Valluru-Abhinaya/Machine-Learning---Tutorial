# Machine-Learning---Tutorial
This repository contains a complete tutorial, Jupyter notebook, and supporting images demonstrating the key concepts behind **Decision Trees** in machine learning.  
It walks through:

- Impurity measures (Gini, Entropy, Misclassification Error)
- Overfitting and tree depth
- Feature importance (impurity-based and permutation importance)
- Decision boundary visualization
- Practical tuning tips
